# Live-Paper Trade Testing Feature Plan

## Information Gathered
- The existing `grid_backtester.py` is dedicated to backtesting and should not be modified for live testing.
- A new module will be created to handle live testing in a paper trading environment.

## Plan
### 1. Create a New Module
- Develop a new Python module (e.g., `live_paper_trader.py`) that will implement the logic for live testing in a paper trading environment.
- This module will utilize the existing trading strategies and allow for simulated trading without executing real trades.

### 2. Integrate with Backend
- Create a new endpoint in `app.py` to handle requests for live paper trading.

### 3. Frontend Updates
- Update the frontend to include options for initiating live paper trading.
- Ensure that the UI reflects the results of paper trades similarly to backtest results.

## Documentation Updates
- Update `docs/TODO.md` to reflect the new tasks related to the live paper trading feature.
- Create a new entry in `docs/CHANGELOG.md` for the live paper trading feature.
- Update the `README.md` files in both backend and frontend to include information about the new feature.

## Follow-up Steps
1. Implement the code changes as outlined in the revised plan.
2. Test the new live paper trading feature thoroughly to ensure it works as expected.
3. Update the documentation files to reflect the new feature and any changes made.
4. Conduct a review of the changes and prepare for deployment.
