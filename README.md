## Current Status
**Version 0.4.0** - The core functionality is complete and the system is stable for backtesting. We're currently working on advanced analytics and UI enhancements.

## Key Features
- **Backtesting Framework** - Simulate grid strategies on historical data with detailed trade logs
- **Interactive Charts** - View price movements and trade executions with candlestick charts (only in backend template yet)
- **Trade Analysis** - Automatic calculation of performance metrics (profit, drawdown, Sharpe ratio)
- **OHLCV Data Caching** - Efficiently fetch and store candle data, reducing API usage (theres a limit of 500 candles for mexc exchange so maybe prep yourself with some historical data for more stable/accurate results)
- **Dynamic Strategy Selection** - Choose between grid and momentum strategies (currently momentum strategy is active for frontend, a selection ui component will follow so it can be dynamically swapped)
- **Responsive Design** - Optimized for desktop and mobile devices (cap)
- **Containerized Deployment** - Easy setup with Docker and Docker Compose (not tested yet, will do when frontend-react-app is ready)

## Recent Enhancements
- Added (hardcoded) strategy selection checks into backend logic
- Implemented responsive design across all pages
- Enhanced chart visualization with volume overlay
- Improved parameter organization and tooltips
- Added backtest management features (renaming, notes, archiving)
